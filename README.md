# cmu-bomb
## Description
Reverse engineering Carnegie Mellon University's Systems Programming binary bomb lab.
I am not a CMU student, this lab is freely availble online for all to download.
[Official CMU README](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/2e/README-bomblab)

## Files
- bomb: binary executable 
- revbomb.c: my reverse engineered each phase into C code
- revbomb: my reverse engineered executable

## What I learned
By solving the 6 phases of this lab I have learned:
- how to reverse engineer x86_64 assembly code into valid C code
- how to disassemble, analyze, and debug binary using command-line tools like gdb and radare2
- how fun (and sometimes aggravating) it is to reverse engineer code
